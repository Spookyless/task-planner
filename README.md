# Task Planner

A completely original app created at Software Mansion Hackathon 2022

## Features

### Fully implemented

- Customize your tasks with title, description, deadline and tags
- Mark tasks as completed with one touch of a button
- Tasks and their states are persistant; saved locally on the device
- Cross platform (we hope)

### Partially implemented / implemented but not used
- Create your own tags
- Smart-sorting of tasks, both completed and not
- Edit previously saved tasks
